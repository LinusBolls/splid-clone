## About

Previously, room booking at CODE was handled through eiter the cumbersome Google Calendar or the confusing Factory Berlin app.
CODE Connection makes booking easier and more accessible to students by focusing on being able to quickly secure a room for an upcoming working session or meeting.

**DISCLAIMER: Even though CODE Connect is produced by and for CODE students, it is not officially associated with CODE University of Applied Sciences!**
